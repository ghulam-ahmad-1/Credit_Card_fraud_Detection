 <h1>Credit Card Fraud Detection </h1>
    <h4>This wor is assigned to me during my internship :</h4>
    <p>I solved This by Using the <b><i>Random Forest Classifier</i></b> which helps me to reach the accuray  :  <b> 99% </b></p>
    <p>Here is the link of my Dataset : <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/isaikumar/creditcardfraud " target="    _blank"> Dataset</a> on which i've worked.</p>
    <p>Is there anything I can do to make it better anyone can sujjest it or edit it. 
    Thanks!</p>
